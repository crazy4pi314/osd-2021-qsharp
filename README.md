Quantum computing is an exciting and growing tech field that has adopted open source languages and platforms to address its unique challenges. 
Just like learning a new package or toolchain in your favorite language, you to can learn quantum computing via open source project and have an impact on the direction of the field! 
In this workshop, we will cover what in the heck quantum computing actually is, what are the current challenges that we can address with open source tools, and you will write your first quantum program in Python and Q#!
